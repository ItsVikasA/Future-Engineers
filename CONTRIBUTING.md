   # upstream  https://github.com/ItsVikasA/Future-Engineers.git (push)
   ```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Environment Configuration

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Firebase Configuration (Get from Firebase Console)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Firebase Admin SDK (Download service account key from Firebase)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your_service_account_email
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

4. **Deploy Firestore Rules** (from project root):
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   firebase login
   firebase init firestore  # Select existing project
   firebase deploy --only firestore
   ```

5. **Get Admin SDK credentials**:
   - Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Service Accounts
   - Click "Generate new private key"
   - Save JSON file securely (don't commit!)
   - Copy values to `.env.local`

## üìê Coding Standards

### General Principles

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Extract repeated code into reusable functions/components
2. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Favor simple solutions over complex ones
3. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Don't add functionality until it's needed
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic, UI, and data access separate
5. **Consistent Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names

### TypeScript Guidelines

**‚úÖ DO:**
```typescript
// Use proper typing
interface UserProfile {
  uid: string;
  displayName: string;
  email: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'contributor' | 'student';
  contributions: number;
}

// Use type inference when obvious
const count = 0; // inferred as number

// Export types for reuse
export type DocumentType = 'Notes' | 'Question Papers' | 'Lab Manuals';
```

**‚ùå DON'T:**
```typescript
// Avoid 'any' type
function processData(data: any) { // Bad
  return data;
}

// Use unknown or proper type instead
function processData(data: unknown) { // Good
  // Type guard needed
}

// Don't skip type definitions
const user = {}; // Bad - implicit any
const user: UserProfile = { ... }; // Good
```

### React Component Guidelines

**‚úÖ Functional Components with Hooks:**
```typescript
// Good component structure
'use client'; // If client component

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button';

interface ProfileCardProps {
  userId: string;
  onUpdate?: () => void;
}

export function ProfileCard({ userId, onUpdate }: ProfileCardProps) {
  const [profile, setProfile] = useState<UserProfile | null>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Fetch profile
  }, [userId]);

  if (loading) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  if (!profile) return null;

  return (
    <div className="...">
      {/* Component JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Component organization:**
1. Imports (external, then internal)
2. Type definitions
3. Component declaration
4. State and hooks
5. Effects
6. Event handlers
7. Helper functions
8. Early returns (loading, error states)
9. Main JSX return

### Styling with Tailwind CSS

**‚úÖ Best Practices:**
```typescript
// Use Tailwind utility classes
<div className="flex items-center justify-between p-4 rounded-lg bg-card shadow-md hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow">
  <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground">Title</h2>
</div>

// Responsive design
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
  {/* Items */}
</div>

// Dark mode support (use theme variables)
<div className="bg-background text-foreground border-border">
  {/* Content */}
</div>
```

**‚ùå Avoid:**
```typescript
// Don't use inline styles (unless absolutely necessary)
<div style={{ padding: '16px', backgroundColor: '#fff' }}> // Bad

// Don't hardcode colors (use theme variables)
<div className="bg-white text-black"> // Bad
<div className="bg-background text-foreground"> // Good
```

### File Organization

**Component files:**
```
ComponentName.tsx          # Single component
  OR
ComponentName/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.tsx           # Main component
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ComponentName.test.tsx  # Tests (future)
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts            # Component-specific types
```

**Naming conventions:**
- Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserProfile.tsx`)
- Utilities: `camelCase` (e.g., `formatDate.ts`)
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_FILE_SIZE`)
- Types/Interfaces: `PascalCase` (e.g., `UserProfile`, `DocumentData`)

### Code Comments

**When to comment:**
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Complex business logic
// Calculate contribution points: 10 per approved document + 5 per download
const points = (approvedDocs * 10) + (totalDownloads * 5);

// ‚úÖ Non-obvious workarounds
// Workaround for Vercel 4.5MB payload limit - use direct upload
const useDirectUpload = file.size > FILE_SIZE_LIMIT || isVercel;

// ‚úÖ Important warnings
// IMPORTANT: Module field only applies to Notes documents
if (documentType === 'Notes' && module) {
  docData.module = module;
}
```

**Don't comment:**
```typescript
// ‚ùå Obvious code
// Set loading to true
setLoading(true); // Bad - self-explanatory

// ‚ùå Instead of comments, use better names
// Check if user is admin
if (u.r === 'a') { } // Bad

if (user.role === 'admin') { } // Good - self-documenting
```

### Error Handling

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Proper error handling
try {
  const result = await uploadFile(file);
  toast.success('Upload successful!');
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Upload failed:', error);
  const message = error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Upload failed';
  toast.error(message);
  throw error; // Re-throw if caller needs to handle
}

// ‚úÖ User-friendly error messages
if (file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
  toast.error(`File too large: ${(file.size / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(1)}MB. Maximum is 4MB.`);
  return;
}
```

### Performance Considerations

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Memoize expensive computations
const sortedDocuments = useMemo(() => {
  return documents.sort((a, b) => b.timestamp - a.timestamp);
}, [documents]);

// ‚úÖ Debounce search inputs
const debouncedSearch = useMemo(
  () => debounce((query: string) => performSearch(query), 300),
  []
);

// ‚úÖ Lazy load heavy components
const PDFViewer = dynamic(() => import('./PDFViewer'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading viewer...</p>,
});
```
